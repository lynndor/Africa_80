                    In 2015 during the World Economic Forum on Africa meeting in
                    Cape Town South Africa, 80 young Africans from across 30
                    countries met and after having been inspired by the great
                    country representation decided to collaborate on a project
                    that would not only be lasting and educational, but would
                    also be a demonstration of the power of collaboration. The
                    coming together of the group and its intentions created such
                    an excitement across the continent where each one of the
                    co-authors had influence, that we managed to secure a
                    Foreword by Ashish Thakkar, widely known at the time as
                    Africa’s youngest billionaire.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A year later on the 25th May 2016 the book was officially
                    launched! During this memorable event, we received support
                    from the South African Government, multiple media platforms,
                    and other stakeholders.
                  </p>
                  This very event marked the birthing of the Africa80 network.
                  Fast forward to today, The Africa80 has managed to not only
                  continue advocating collaboration as a tool to transforming
                  our economies for the better, but we have cultivated and in
                  other cases created partnerships that are key to the success
                  of the network through the amplification of network member
                  voices.
                  <p>
                    <br /> Although we consider our network as continuously
                    growing and evolving, we remain committed to playing our
                    part in improving the state of Africa by using our skill,
                    resources, and network to preach and act collaboration.
